wers have access to their credit score as determined by Lending Club. Obviously lower grade of credit results in higher return. Typically loans orignated during different times come with different level of returns. This makes it hard to have a metric to compare loans across credit level excluding the impact of when the loan was originated.

We aim to analyze the realized return/volatility for each one of these vintage by grade combinations to see if we uncover any insight.
